This is a tiny lightning fast list of things you dislike.

## Changing the list:

This is very easy, there is file called "list.txt" in project.
The list's synatx is as follows (Don't include "//Header" or "//Items", thats just there for explaining)
```
Songs //Header
x,y,z //Items
```
That's all there is to the syntax.
